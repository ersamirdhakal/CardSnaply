/**
 * README: CardSnaply Mobile App Complete
 * 
 * The React Native mobile app has been successfully created!
 * 
 * NEXT STEPS:
 * 
 * 1. Install Dependencies:
 *    cd mobile
 *    npm install
 * 
 * 2. Note: Some dependencies may need native linking or additional setup:
 *    - react-native-vision-camera: May require additional native configuration
 *    - react-native-tesseract-ocr: Verify OCR library compatibility
 *    - react-native-contacts: Requires native permissions
 *    - react-native-qrcode-scanner: May need alternative QR library
 * 
 * 3. For QR scanning, you may need to use:
 *    - expo-camera with manual QR detection
 *    - Or react-native-qrcode-scanner (may need adjustments)
 *    - Or integrate jsQR library manually
 * 
 * 4. For OCR, verify:
 *    - react-native-tesseract-ocr supports your React Native version
 *    - Language data files are bundled
 *    - Consider alternative: react-native-text-recognition
 * 
 * 5. Test camera permissions:
 *    - iOS: Info.plist permissions are in app.json
 *    - Android: Manifest permissions are in app.json
 * 
 * 6. Add App Assets:
 *    - Create assets/icon.png (1024x1024)
 *    - Create assets/splash.png (2048x2048)
 *    - Create assets/adaptive-icon.png (1024x1024 for Android)
 *    - Create assets/favicon.png (48x48 for web)
 * 
 * IMPORTANT NOTES:
 * 
 * - The app structure is complete and ready for testing
 * - Some libraries may need version adjustments based on your Expo SDK version
 * - Camera and OCR libraries may require additional native module configuration
 * - Test thoroughly on physical devices before production deployment
 *
