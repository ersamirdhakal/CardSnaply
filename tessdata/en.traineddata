PLACEHOLDER FILE - Replace with real en.traineddata

This is a placeholder file. Replace it with the actual Tesseract 4 compatible English language data file.

Download from: https://tessdata.projectnaptha.com/4.0.0/eng.traineddata.gz
Extract and rename to: en.traineddata (or use eng.traineddata if using 'eng' language code)

File size should be approximately 4-5 MB when extracted.

Note: The OCR code uses 'eng' language code which expects eng.traineddata by default.
If you want to use this file as en.traineddata, you may need to update ocr.js to use 'en' language code.
